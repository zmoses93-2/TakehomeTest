# This spec was generated by rspec-rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
# It demonstrates how one might use RSpec to test the controller code that
# was generated by Rails when you ran the scaffold generator.
#
# It assumes that the implementation code is generated by the rails scaffold
# generator. If you are using any extension libraries to generate different
# controller code, this generated spec may or may not pass.
#
# It only uses APIs available in rails and/or rspec-rails. There are a number
# of tools you can use to make these specs even more expressive, but we're
# sticking to rails and rspec-rails APIs to keep things simple and stable.

  # This should return the minimal set of attributes required to create a valid
  # Device. As you add validations to Device, be sure to

  # This should return the minimal set of values that should be in the headers
  # in order to pass any filters (e.g. authentication) defined in
  # DevicesController, or in your router and rack
  # middleware. Be sure to keep this updated too.
